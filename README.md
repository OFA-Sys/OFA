OFA is a unified multimodal pretrained model that unifies modalities (i.e., cross-modality, vision, language) and tasks 
(e.g., image generation, visual grounding, image captioning, image classification, text generation, etc.) 
to a simple sequence-to-sequence learning framework. For more information, please refer to our paper: [Unifying Architectures, Tasks, and Modalities Through a Simple Sequence-to-Sequence Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03052).

# Finetuning & Inference
Below we provide methods for finetuning and inference on different downstream tasks.
## Image Captioning
We provide procedures to reproduce our results of image captioning on our paper below.
<details>
    <summary><b>1. Prepare the Dataset & Checkpoints</b></summary>
    <p>
        Download data (see <a href='datasets.md'>datasets.md</a>) and models (see <a href='checkpoints.md'>checkpoints.md</a>) and put them in the correct directory. The dataset zipfile <code>caption_data.zip</code> contains caption_stage1_train.tsv, caption_stage2_train.tsv, caption_val.tsv and caption_test.tsv. Each image corresponds to only 1 caption in <code>caption_stage1_train.tsv</code> and corresponds to multiple captions in other TSV files (about 5 captions per image). Each line of the dataset represents a caption sample with the following format. The information of uniq-id, image-id, caption, predicted object labels (taken from <a href='https://github.com/pzzhang/VinVL'>VinVL</a>, not used), image base64 string are separated by tabs.

</pre>
</details>
<details>
    <summary><b>2. Finetuning</b></summary>
    <p>
        Following previous standard practice, we divide the finetuning process of image captioning into two stages. In stage 1, we finetune OFA with cross-entropy loss on 4 NVIDIA-V100 GPUs with 32GB memory (expected to obtain ~139.5 CIDEr on the validation set at this stage). In stage 2, we select the best checkpoint of stage 1 and train with CIDEr optimization on 8 NVIDIA-V100 GPUs (expected to get ~149.4 CIDEr on the validation set at this stage). <b>Note that CIDEr optimization is very unstable and requires careful hyperparameter tuning. If you encounter training errors in the stage2 finetuning, you can increase the batch size or reduce the learning rate. If neither of these works, you can directly set </b><code>--freeze-resnet</code><b> to freeze the inner states of batch normalization.</b>
    </p>
<pre>
cd run_scripts/caption
nohup sh train_caption_stage1.sh > train_stage1.out &  # stage 1, train with cross-entropy loss
nohup sh train_caption_stage2.sh > train_stage2.out &  # stage 2, load the best ckpt of stage1 and train with CIDEr optimization 
</pre>
</details>
<details>
    <summary><b>3. Inference</b></summary>
    <p>
        Run the following commands to get your results and evaluate your model.
    </p>
<pre>
cd run_scripts/caption ; sh evaluate_caption.sh  # inference & evaluate
</pre>
</details>

## Text-to-Image Generation 
This part provides procedures for the finetuning and inference of text-to-image generation. See below.

<details>
    <summary><b>1. Prepare the Dataset & Checkpoints</b></summary>
    <p>
        Download data (see <a href="datasets.md">datasets.md</a>) and models (see <a href="checkpoints.md">checkpoints.md</a>) and put them in the correct directory. The dataset zipfile <code>coco_image_gen.zip</code> contains <code>coco_vqgan_train.tsv</code>, <code>coco_vqgan_dev.tsv</code> and <code>coco_vqgan_full_test.tsv</code>. Each line of the dataset represents a sample with the following format. The information of uniq-id, image-code (produced by <a href="https://github.com/CompVis/taming-transformers">vqgan</a>, a list of integers separated by single-whitespaces), lowercased caption are separated by tabs.
    </p>

</pre>
    <p>
        The checkpoint zipfile <code>image_gen_large_best.zip</code> contains <code>image_gen_large_best.pt</code>, <code>vqgan/last.ckpt</code>, <code>vqgan/model.yaml</code> and <code>clip/Vit-B-16.pt</code>. 
    </p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary><b>2. Shuffle the Training Data</b></summary>
    <p>
        (Optional, but achieves better result): If the disk storage is sufficient, we recommend to prepare the shuffled training data for each epoch in advance. 
    </p>
<pre>
cd dataset/image_gen
ln coco_vqgan_train.tsv coco_vqgan_train_1.tsv
for idx in `seq 1 9`;do shuf coco_vqgan_train_${idx}.tsv > coco_vqgan_train_$[${idx}+1].tsv;done # each file is used for an epoch
</pre>
</details>
<details>
    <summary><b>3. Finetuning</b></summary>
    <p>
        Following previous practice, we divide the finetuning process of image generating into two stages. In stage 1, we finetune OFA with cross-entropy loss on 4 8-V100-32G-GPU servers (expected to obtain ~32.5+ CLIP Score on the validation set at this stage). In stage 2, we select the last checkpoint of stage 1 and train with CLIP Score optimization on 4 8-V100-32G-GPU servers (expected to obtain ~34.0+ CLIP Score on the validation set at this stage). During the validation, the generated image will be dumped into <code>_GEN_IMAGE_PATH_</code>. 
    </p>
<pre>
# run on each worker after the distributed and data configs have been correctly set following the guide in train_image_gen_stage1_distributed.sh 
cd run_scripts/image_gen
nohup sh train_image_gen_stage1_distributed.sh # stage 1, train with cross-entropy loss
nohup sh train_image_gen_stage2_distributed.sh # stage 2, load the last ckpt of stage1 and train with CLIP Score optimization 
</pre>
</details>
<details>
    <summary><b>4. Inference</b></summary>
    <p>
        Run the command below to generate your images. 
    </p>
<pre>
cd run_scripts/image_gen ; sh evaluate_image_gen.sh  # inference & evaluate (FID, IS and CLIP Score)
</pre>
</details>

## Visual Question Answering
Here we provide the finetuning and inference codes to reproduce the VQAv2 result reported in our paper (**test-std 80.02**). We believe much improvement on accuracy can still be achieved based on this codebase :)
<details>
    <summary><b>1. Prepare the Dataset & Checkpoints</b></summary>
    <p>
        Download data (see <a href="datasets.md">datasets.md</a>) and models (see <a href="checkpoints.md">checkpoints.md</a>) and put them in the correct directory. The dataset zipfile <code>vqa_data.zip</code> is around 100G and the decompressed data costs around 135G disk storage, which contains the training, validation and testing samples together with other necessary data resources. Following common practice, VG-QA samples are also included in the training data. To adapt to the seq2seq paradigm of OFA, we transform original VQA training questions with multiple golden answers into multiple training samples. For the original VQA validation set, we keep around 10k samples for our validation and utilize the other samples for training. Each line of the dataset represents a VQA sample with the following format. The information of question-id, image-id, question, answer (with confidence), predicted object labels (taken from <a href="https://github.com/pzzhang/VinVL">VinVL</a>, slightly brings around +0.1 accuracy improvement), image base64 string are separated by tabs.

<details>
    <summary><b>2. Shuffle the Training Data</b></summary>
    <p>
        (Optional, but achieves better finetuning accuracy): If the disk storage is sufficient, we recommend to prepare the shuffled training data for each epoch in advance. In our experiments, we use shuffling which brings around <b>+0.3</b> improvement on VQA accuracy.
    </p>
<pre>
cd dataset/vqa_data
ln vqa_train.tsv vqa_train_1.tsv
for idx in `seq 1 9`;do shuf vqa_train_${idx}.tsv > vqa_train_$[${idx}+1].tsv;done # each file is used for an epoch
</pre>
</details>
<details>
    <summary><b>3. Finetuning</b></summary>
    <p>
        In our experiments, the VQA finetuning is performed on 4 8-A100-GPU servers (<i>with RDMA</i>). Here provides the finetuning script <code>train_vqa_distributed.sh</code>, which supports multi-server distributed training (as well as single-server training). Please refer to the comments in the beginning of the script and set the configs correctly according to your distribution environment. If you have shuffled the training data in the previous step, please correctly specify the training data path following the guide in the script comments. <b>The command should be run on each worker.</b> 
    </p>
<pre>
# run on each worker after the distributed and data configs have been correctly set following the guide in train_vqa_distributed.sh 
cd run_scripts/vqa
bash train_vqa_distributed.sh 
</pre>
    <p>
        In our experiments, the finetuning costs around 36 hours (for 12 epochs). After each epoch, an evaluation on validation set is performed. The best validation accuracy during finetuning will be around 80.8. The log is saved in <code>${log_dir}</code>.
    </p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary><b>4. Inference</b></summary>
    <p>
        We provide 2 types of inference, <b>beam-search</b> (much faster but gets sub-optimal accuracy) and <b>all-candidate evaluation</b> (slower but best accuracy). <br></br>
        For beam-search inference, use the script <code>evaluate_vqa_beam.sh</code>. Refer to the command below. The inference on test set costs around 16 GPU hours. After inference on test set, the result JSON file will be dumped in the <code>${result_path}</code> defined in the shell script. You can submit the result <code>test_predict.json</code> to <a href="https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/830/overview">EvalAI</a>. Using our released finetuned checkpoint, beam-search inference will get 80.15 validation accuracy, 79.36 test-dev accuracy and 79.48 test-std accuracy (around 0.6 lower than all-candidate evaluation).
    </p>
<pre>
cd run_scripts/vqa
bash evaluate_vqa_beam.sh val # specify 'val' or 'test'
</pre>
    <p>
        For all-candidate evaluation, we recommend to use the distributed script <code>evaluate_vqa_allcand_distributed.sh</code>. Please refer to the guide in the script to set the distributed configs before running. The result JSON file will be dumped in the <code>${result_path}</code> defined in the shell script of rank-0 server. All-candidate evaluation computes scores on all the candidate answers in the VQA dataset, which achieves <b>80.82</b> validation accuracy, <b>79.87</b> test-dev accuracy and <b>80.02</b> test-std accuracy, reproducing our reported results in the paper. However, the inference on test set costs around 1k GPU hours, which is much slower.
    </p>
<pre>
# run on each worker after the distributed configs have been correctly set following the guide in evaluate_vqa_allcand_distributed.sh
cd run_scripts/vqa
bash evaluate_vqa_allcand_distributed.sh val # specify 'val' or 'test'
</pre>

## Referring Expression Comprehension 
Here provides procedures for you to prepare data, train, and evaluate your model on visual grounding. 
<details>
    <summary><b>1. Prepare the Dataset & Checkpoints</b></summary>
    <p>
        Download data (see <a href='datasets.md'>datasets.md</a>) and models (see <a href='checkpoints.md'>checkpoints.md</a>) and put them in the correct directory. We provide RefCOCO (split by UNC), RefCOCO+ (split by UNC) and RefCOCOg (split by UMD) datasets. See <a href='https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/ref_coco'>RefCOCO</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lichengunc/refer">Refer</a> for more details. Note that in the original dataset, each region-coord (or bounding box) may corresponds to multiple descriptive texts. We split these texts into multiple samples so that the region-coord in each sample corresponds to only one text. Each line of the processed dataset represents a sample with the following format. The information of uniq-id, image-id, text, region-coord (separated by commas), image base64 string are separated by tabs.

## Image Classification on ImageNet-1K
We provide the finetuning and inference codes which reproduce **85.0 ImageNet-1K accuracy**, slightly better than reported in our paper. 

<details>
    <summary><b>1. Prepare the Dataset & Checkpoints</b></summary>
    <p>
        Download data (see <a href="datasets.md">datasets.md</a>) and models (see <a href="checkpoints.md">checkpoints.md</a>) and put them in the correct directory. Our provided data is derived from the original <a href="http://image-net.org/">ImageNet-1K</a> (ILSVRC2012 train & validation) dataset and shares the same data split with it. To formulate the classification task into seq2seq paradigm, we use the <a href="https://github.com/HoldenCaulfieldRye/caffe/blob/master/data/ilsvrc12/synset_words.txt">synset words</a> provided by Caffe as the generation target for each image class. Each line of the processed dataset represents a sample with the following format. The information of image base64 string, classification label (1-indexed, conform to the order in <code>synset_words.txt</code>), synset words of the label are separated by tabs.

        In our experiments, the ImageNet-1K finetuning is performed on 2 8-A100-GPU servers (<i>with RDMA</i>). Here provides the finetuning script <code>train_imagenet_distributed.sh</code>, which supports multi-server distributed training (as well as single-server training). Please refer to the comments in the beginning of the script and set the configs correctly according to your distribution environment. If you have shuffled the training data in the previous step, please correctly specify the training data path following the guide in the script comments. <b>The command should be run on each worker.</b> For quick evaluation during finetuning, by default we sample 20% of the original validation split and report accuracy on this subset after each epoch. The accuracy on the validation subset is generally ±0.1 relative to accuracy on the whole validation split.
